## 🧩 Tasks Overview

### **Part 1 — Theoretical Understanding**
- Explained key differences between **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **spaCy**.
- Compared frameworks based on **use case, ease of use**, and **community support**.

---

### **Part 2 — Practical Implementation**

#### 🟢 Task 1: Classical ML (Scikit-learn)
- Dataset: **Iris Species**
- Model: Decision Tree Classifier
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall  
- Output: Confusion matrix visualization and prediction summary.

#### 🟡 Task 2: Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Dataset: **MNIST Handwritten Digits**
- Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Goal: >95% test accuracy  
- Output: Accuracy plot and sample digit predictions.

#### 🔵 Task 3: NLP (spaCy + NLTK)
- Dataset: **Amazon-style reviews**
- Tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER) + Sentiment Analysis
- Tools: `spaCy`, `TextBlob`, `NLTK`
- Output: Entities extracted, sentiment polarity score, and WordCloud visualization.

---

### **Bonus Task — Streamlit App**
- Created an interactive **Streamlit web app** for live text sentiment prediction.
- Users can input text and see instant **Positive/Negative** feedback.
- Designed with emojis and color-coded sentiment bars for creativity 🎨

To run locally:
```bash
cd streamlit_app
streamlit run app.py
Part 3 — Ethics & Optimization
Reflected on bias in datasets like MNIST and user reviews.

Discussed how tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators and spaCy rule-based filters can reduce discrimination.

Debugged and optimized TensorFlow code with clear documentation.
