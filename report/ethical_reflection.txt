Ethical Reflection â€” AI Tools Assignment

Potential Biases:

In the MNIST digit classification model, biases may arise if certain digits are overrepresented, leading to unequal accuracy across classes.

In the Amazon Reviews text analysis, sentiment models like TextBlob may interpret slang, emojis, or sarcasm incorrectly, misrepresenting user emotions.

Language models can also carry cultural and linguistic biases from their training data.

Mitigation Strategies:

Tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators can be used to detect accuracy differences across data subsets.

Using balanced datasets ensures fair representation of all categories.

In NLP tasks, rule-based systems (like spaCy patterns) or fine-tuning on diverse local datasets can reduce bias and improve fairness.

Regular bias testing and human review improve ethical compliance and model accountability.

Ethical Importance:
Ethical AI ensures that automated systems are fair, transparent, and trustworthy. Developers must prioritize inclusivity and responsibility to prevent harm from algorithmic decisions.
